Restructured Text Example
=========================
RST or Restructured Text markup is a powerful markup language.
It's more powerful than MarkDown (MD) and used in Linux-style documentation
(using ``Spinx <spinx-doc.org>`_``).
MD is **not** upwards compatible with RST.
So, for these reasons I recommend using RST for non-trivial documentation
(anything more than a simple README),
``Github <github.com>`_`` renders RST similar to MD.

For examples of RST markdown, see the Sawtooth FAQ source at
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-website/tree/master/generator/source/faq
and the generated result at
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/faq/

I usually debug RST by creating and pushing a new branch to Github.
Then I view the new or modified file in the branch I pushed.
There are also standalone RST viewers available.
Be aware RST has minor variations with different implementations,
so the best way to check Github RST is to use Github.

Simple Examples
===============
I will show several examples here that I taken from the FAQ example above.
The title above was generated by adding ``=`` under the next line.

Start a new paragraph with an empty newline.

- To use *italic* surround with single asterisk characters ``*``
- To use **bold** surround with double asterisk characters ``**``
- To use  ``monospace`` surround with double backquote characters, "``"
  (without the quotes)
- You can also simply insert HTML code for complex markup if you know HTML
- For a link, place the link text followed by the URL in angle brackets in backquotes followed by underscore

  - For example, ```Github <github.com>`_`` becomes  `Github <github.com>`_
  - You can also just use the URL itself and it will become a link automatically.

    - For example, https://github.com/
- You can link to other files by just placing using the filename.
  For example, ```Sample <./sample.rst>`_`` becomes  `Sample <./sample.rst>`_

Subheadings
-----------
Use a single dash characters `---` on the next line for second level subheadings,
the same length as the heading text.

Lists
=====

- Preceed the list with a blank line
- Use single dash character ``-`` at the beginning of the line
- Second item
- Third item
- To nest a list, indent the items by four spaces and preceed with a blank line

    - First nested item preceeded with a blank line
    - Second nested item

#. For a numbered list, use the pound sign followed by a period, ``#.``
#. Second item
#. Third item

    #. First nested item preceeded with a blank line and indented four spaces
    #. Second nested item

Code
======

To add code blocks, use ``.. code:: sh`` where ``sh`` is the (optional) language
(sh, python, c, cpp, js, rst),
preceeded and followed by a blank line, then the code.
For example:

.. code:: python

        # Simple Python program
        print ('hello world!')


Tables
======
There are many ways to make a table. The easiest is just to use ASCII graphics.
For example, this:

.. code::

    +--------------+-----------+----------+
    | PROGRAMMING  |           |          |
    | LANGUAGE     | EXTENSION | RELEASED |
    +==============+===========+==========+
    | C++          | .cpp      | 1985     |
    +--------------+-----------+----------+
    | Python       | .py       | 1991     |
    +--------------+-----------+----------+

Becomes this:

+--------------+-----------+----------+
| PROGRAMMING  |           |          |
| LANGUAGE     | EXTENSION | RELEASED |
+==============+===========+==========+
| C++          | .cpp      | 1985     |
+--------------+-----------+----------+
| Python       | .py       | 1991     |
+--------------+-----------+----------+

Several cheatsheets are available.
I usually just look for "restructured text" and the formatting I want in a search engine.
Here are two random cheat sheets:
