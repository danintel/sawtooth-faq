Restructured Text Example
=========================
RST or Restructured Text markup is a powerful markup language.
It's more powerful than MarkDown (MD) and used in Linux-style documentation (using Sphinx).
MD is not upwards compatible with RST.
So, for these reasons I recommend using RST for non-trivial documentation (anything more than a simple README),
Github.com renders RST similar to MD.
For examples of RST markdown, see the Sawtooth FAQ source at
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-website/tree/master/generator/source/faq
and generated result at
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/faq/

Simple Examples
===============
I will show several examples here that I taken from the FAQ example above.
The title above was generated by adding ``=`` under the next line.

* To use *italic* surround with single asterisk characters ``*``
* To use **bold** surround with double asterisk characters ``**``
* To use  ``monospace`` surround with double backquote characters, "``" (without the quotes)
* For a link, place the link text followed by the URL in angle brackets in backquotes followed by underscore
  * For example, ```python <www.python.org>`_`` becomes  `python <www.python.org>`_
  * You can also just use the URL itself and it will become a link automatically.
    * For example, https://www.python.org/

Subheadings
-----------
Use a single dash characters `-` on the next line for second level subheadings.

Lists
=====

* Preceed the list with a blank line
* Use single asterisk character ``*`` at the beginning of the line
* Second item
* Third item
* To next a list, indent the items
  * First nested item preceeded with a blank line
  * Second nested item

# For a numbered list, use the pound sign ``#``
# Second item
# Third item

  # First nested item preceeded with a blank line
  # Second nested item

Code
======

To add code blocks, use ``.. code:: sh`` where ``sh`` is the (optional) language
(sh, python, c, cpp, js, rst),
preceeded and followed by a blank line, then the code.
For example:

.. code:: python

        # Simple Python program
        print ('hello world!')
        

Tables
======
There are many ways to make a table.  The easiest is just to use ASCII graphics.  For example, this:

code:: rst

+--------------+-----------+----------+
| PROGRAMMING  |           |          |
| LANGUAGE     | EXTENSION | RELEASED |
+==============+===========+==========+
| C++          | .cpp      | 1985     |
+--------------+-----------+----------+
| Python       | .py       | 1991     |
+--------------+-----------+----------+

Becomes this:

+--------------+-----------+----------+
| PROGRAMMING  |           |          |
| LANGUAGE     | EXTENSION | RELEASED |
+==============+===========+==========+
| C++          | .cpp      | 1985     |
+--------------+-----------+----------+
| Python       | .py       | 1991     |
+--------------+-----------+----------+

==========
Several cheatsheets are available.
I usually just look for "restructured text" and the formatting I want in a search engine.
Here are two random cheat sheets:
